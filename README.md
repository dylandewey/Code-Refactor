# week_1-
In this website I was able to make the html format a little more readable for the developer. I cleaned up tabs and spacing. 

None of the images had an alt attribues so I gave them all an alt attribute.

I was able to fix one of the links at the top of the page that was not taking you anywhere when clicked.

There was no title to the webpage so I added a title that would help it be found in search engines.
